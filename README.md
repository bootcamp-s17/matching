# matching
Card matching game!

Create a card matching game with a standard 52 playing card deck.

## Requirements
Multiplayer
Score Tracking
Cards are randomly shuffled
Cards are generated via ng-repeat
Sexy animation of card flips
When you're down to 10 cards left, I want you to shuffle the remaining cards every round
Win and draw state

## Technologies
* gulp: practice setting up a project using gulp. Gulp can help automate a lot of your tasks!
* sass/bootstrap: practice using css frameworks!
* angularJs: explore the many functions angular has to offer! (e.g. ng-repeat, ng-if, ng-hide, etc.)

## Extra Practice
It's good to compare and contrast different technologies. Try building the game in jQuery/Javascript first.
Afterwards build a version with angular.
